# OculusVR log capture tool
Outdated tool that helped me in measuring game performance on Oculus devices.
I decided to use JSnode to handle logs captured in cmd and socket.io library to connect it to html UI

When oculus device was conected to a PC and "Start Logcat" button pressed, all the data boxes would fill with last captured response from VR_Api process
